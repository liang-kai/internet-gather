The basic architecture concepts I wish I knew when I was getting started as a web developer

副标题：我希望当时作为一名初学者就该掌握的关键概念



The above diagram is fairly good representation of our architecture at Storyblocks. If you're not experienced web developer, you'll likely find it complicated. The walk through below should make it more approachable before we dive into the details of each component.

上图描述了我在 Storyblocks 用到的知识结构，如果你是初学者，可能会认为它复杂。在我们深入每个概念的细节之前先举个例子会更好理解些。

> A user searches on Google for “Strong Beautiful Fog And Sunbeams In The Forest”. The first result happens to be from Storyblocks, our leading stock photo and vectors site. The user clicks the result which redirects their browser to the image details page. Underneath the hood the user’s browser sends a request to a DNS server to lookup how to contact Storyblocks, and then sends the request.

> 某用户在google上搜索“Strong Beautiful Fog And Sunbeams In The Forest”，第一个结果恰巧来自于Storyblocks，我们领先的 [re]stock photo 和适量图网站。用户点击了链接并跳转到了详情页面。这个过程中浏览器请求了DNS的服务来找寻如何连接 Storyblocks, 之后发送请求。

> The request hits our load balancer, which randomly chooses one of the 10 or so web servers we have running the site at the time to process the request. The web server looks up some information about the image from our caching service and fetches the remaining data about it from the database. We notice that the color profile for the image has not been computed yet, so we send a “color profile” job to our job queue, which our job servers will process asynchronously, updating the database appropriately with the results.

> 这个请求打到了负载均衡，由它随机地转发到我们部署的10台web服务器里的一台来处理。web服务器从缓存服务中找寻这个照片的相关信息并且从数据库中获取相关数据。此时我们注意到这个照片的颜色属性还没有被计算出来，所以发起一次计算颜色的任务添加到队列，当这个任务异步处理完成之后，会用计算结果适当地更新数据库。

> Next, we attempt to find similar photos by sending a request to our full text search service using the title of the photo as input. The user happens to be a logged into Storyblocks as a member so we look up his account information from our account service. Finally, we fire off a page view event to our data firehose to be recorded on our cloud storage system and eventually loaded into our data warehouse, which analysts use to help answer questions about the business.

> 接下来，我们尝试使用图片的名称在全文搜索引擎里找相关的图片。用户恰好也是一个注册用户的话我们也会调取账户服务获取他的相关信息。最终，我们还会发送页面要被浏览的事件到云存储系统并最终收集到我们的warehouse,提供给分析师来帮助分析我们的商业问题。

> The server now renders the view as HTML and sends it back to the user’s browser, passing first through the load balancer. The page contains Javascript and CSS assets that we load into our cloud storage system, which is connected to our CDN, so the user’s browser contacts the CDN to retrieve the content. Lastly, the browser visibly renders the page for the user to see.

> 想在，服务器返回一个HTML的文本并且再次经过负载均衡发送给用户的浏览器。页面包含的javascript脚本和CSS文件也是存储在云静态资源，当然也是解析到我们的CDN。用户的浏览器会查找CDN来找到连接地址。最终浏览器渲染出页面用户就可以看了。

Next I'll walk you through each component, providing a "101" introduction to each that should give you a good mental model for thinking through web architecture going forward. I'll follow up with another series of articles providing sepecific implementation recommendations based onwaht I've learn in my time at Storyblocks.

接下来我会介绍每一个概念，罗列每个概念里的要点，以在你的脑海中构建一个完整的web架构。我将跟进另一个系列的文章，并根据我在 Storyblocks 学到的提供具体的实施建议。

## 1. DNS
DNS stands for “Domain Name System” and it’s a backbone technology that makes the world wide web possible. At the most basic level DNS provides a key/value lookup from a domain name (e.g., google.com) to an IP address (e.g., 85.129.83.120), which is required in order for your computer to route a request to the appropriate server. Analogizing to phone numbers, the difference between a domain name and IP address is the difference between “call John Doe” and “call 201-867–5309.” Just like you needed a phone book to look up John’s number in the old days, you need DNS to look up the IP address for a domain. So you can think of DNS as the phone book for the internet.

DNS 即 域名系统，它是使得全世界的网络连接起来的一个关键技术。基本的DNS服务提供一种‘key/value’的查找，例如从域名(google.com)到一个IP(5.129.83.120),以便你的设备通过IP路由找到对应的服务器。举个手机号码的例子，域名到IP的对应就像你操作”呼叫 小明“和“拨号 201-867–5309”，就像以前需要一个电话本来查找小明的电话号码，你需要DNS来通过域名找到IP。你可以认为DNS就是互联网上的电话本。

There’s a lot more detail we could go into here but we’ll skip over it because it’s not critical for our 101-level intro.

为了单纯做概要的介绍，我们选择忽略一些本可以介绍的细节。

2. Load Balancer
Before diving into details on load balancing, we need to take a step back to discuss horizontal vs. vertical application scaling. What are they and what’s the difference? Very simply put in this StackOverflow post, horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas “vertical” scaling means that you scale by adding more power (e.g., CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.

In web development, you (almost) always want to scale horizontally because, to keep it simple, stuff breaks. Servers crash randomly. Networks degrade. Entire data centers occasionally go offline. Having more than one server allows you to plan for outages so that your application continues running. In other words, your app is “fault tolerant.” Secondly, horizontal scaling allows you to minimally couple different parts of your application backend (web server, database, service X, etc.) by having each of them run on different servers. Lastly, you may reach a scale where it’s not possible to vertically scale any more. There is no computer in the world big enough to do all your app’s computations. Think Google’s search platform as a quintessential example though this applies to companies at much smaller scales. Storyblocks, for example, runs 150 to 400 AWS EC2 instances at any given point in time. It would be challenging to provide that entire compute power via vertical scaling.

Ok, back to load balancers. They’re the magic sauce that makes scaling horizontally possible. They route incoming requests to one of many application servers that are typically clones / mirror images of each other and send the response from the app server back to the client. Any one of them should process the request the same way so it’s just a matter of distributing the requests across the set of servers so none of them are overloaded.

That’s it. Conceptually load balancers are fairly straight forward. Under the hood there are certainly complications but no need to dive in for our 101 version.
